Greetings Mr. Moriarti,

it is with great pleasure that I may inform you that the details of our deal 
have been worked out by our financial compartsments.

The entire procedure will be completed until March next year.

Kind regards

P.J.

PS: this is great news for me personally, as my wife will be having a baby 
by April, so I will be unavailable for a few weeks during the period thereafter.
